				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<img src="assets/images/Profile_500x500.jpg">
				<p>As a young adolescent, I wasn't interested in sports, boys, or the next party.  I was one of those school “geeks” who went to math tournaments on the weekends and asked my Algebra I teacher for the Algebra II textbook because I was bored in class.</p>
				<p>While most kids wandered the local malls or cruised a two mile stretch on the main town drag for fun, I poured over logic puzzles.  Real fun was contemplating that Susie lived next to Dave, Bob wore red, Amy loved basketball, all added up to mean that Nancy's dog was a beagle.  The other kids didn't know what they were missing.</p>
				<p>I mistakenly thought that all of this added up to a love for math which began a stretch of 10+ years in accounting but was in truth a period of pure misery.  Then one day, I was asked to help my husband code a client's website in HTML and CSS.  A world of amazement unfolded before my eyes filled with the beauty of syntax and function as one line after another performed some miracle task  as a website design unfolded before my eyes.</p>
				<p>It was then that I fell in love with programming and began my journey to learn and grow as a full stack developer with the ultimate goal of leaving the drudery of accounting behind to enter into the awe inspiring world of logic, function, and creativity.</p>
